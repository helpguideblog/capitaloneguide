Overview
--------

Activate your new card online, in the Capital One Mobile app, or by phone. The steps below are short, safe, and easy to follow.


Before You Start
----------------

- Your new card (number, expiration date, and security code)
- Primary cardholder info for verification (e.g., last 4 of SSN/ITIN for U.S. accounts)
- Your Capital One username & password (or the phone/email that receives verification codes)

Option 1: Activate Online (Fastest)
-----------------------------------

#. Go to `capitalone.com/activate <https://www.capitalone.com/activate/>`_.
#. Sign in (or enroll if you’re new).
#. Select the card to activate and follow the prompts (security code, identity check).
#. You’ll see a confirmation once your card is active.

Option 2: Use the Capital One Mobile App
----------------------------------------

#. Open the app and sign in.
#. Tap the card you want to activate.
#. Choose **Activate** (or **Finish Setup**) and follow the steps.
#. If prompted, create or confirm your card PIN.

Option 3: Activate by Phone
---------------------------

- Call the activation number printed on the sticker on your new card.
- Follow the automated prompts to verify and activate.
- Ask for a representative if you prefer human assistance.

.. tip::
   Remove the activation sticker after you’re done so it doesn’t obscure your card details later.

Troubleshooting
---------------

- **Card not showing up:** Log out and back in, or confirm you’re using the correct Capital One profile.
- **Verification code not arriving:** Check your phone/email on file, look in spam/blocked messages, then request a new code.
- **Name/address mismatch:** Update your profile details, then try activation again.
- **Still stuck?** Contact Capital One using the number on the back of your card or via the **Help** section of the app.
